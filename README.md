## Description

The ORM E-Commerce application is built with Node.js, Express.js, MySQL2, and Sequelize. This week in the UW Coding Bootcamp, we have learned how to further integrate Express.js and a MySQL database using Sequelize, an ORM that can handle queries through functions and represents data through objects. Understanding this architecture is fundamental for students like myself due to the prevalence of e-commerce sites in today's world. This application allows users to create a basic, but efficient, log of products that can be sorted into tags and categories. This makes keeping track of inventory and finding specific items fast and quick even with a large volume of data. 

## Installation

No installation is necessary. This will not be a deployed application, but a walkthrough video can be viewed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ie-NUiBwgdHsOcX4UeBblz7hqT4YmNY/view.

## Usage

This application is designed to be used as an inventory management system. You can view, add, update, and delete products, categories, and tags. Each of these actions has a designated route which is currently being accessed through Insomnia. Simply go to the correct URL, write a JSON body if needed, and send the request. To start the app, run the command "npm server.js" or "nodemon" if you installed that package. New students and developers may find it helpful to view the code to see how packages are implemented and work together to create this application. Code has been commented to describe functionality.
